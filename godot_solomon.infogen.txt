🧭 Project Roadmap (6–8 Sessions)

Session 1: Setup + Godot Basics
Goal: Learn the editor, nodes, and GDScript syntax.
- Install Godot (latest 4.x version).
- Create a new project (PacmanClone).
- Learn about Scenes, Nodes, and Scripts.
- Implement a static maze (just a TileMap).
- Write a simple movement script for Pac-Man (arrow keys, grid-based movement).

Key Learning:
- Scene system
- Input actions (Input.is_action_pressed())
- Vector2, signals, and _process()

Session 2: Smooth Movement & Collision
Goal: Make Pac-Man move smoothly and collide with walls.
- Add a CollisionShape2D and RigidBody2D or CharacterBody2D.
- Use move_and_slide() or move_and_collide().
- Ensure Pac-Man stops at walls.
- Add a “tunnel” teleport between sides.

Key Learning:
- Physics system
- Movement vectors
- Collision layers and masks

Session 3: Pellets + Score
Goal: Add collectible dots and score tracking.
- Place pellets with a TileMap or as individual nodes.
- Detect collisions with pellets.
- Add a score label.
- Remove pellets on collection.

Key Learning:
- Signals (body_entered, area_entered)
- Modifying nodes at runtime
- UI with Label and CanvasLayer

Session 4: Ghosts (Enemies)
Goal: Introduce basic ghosts.
- Create a Ghost scene.
- Add simple patrol AI (random or path-based).
- Detect collision with Pac-Man → restart level.

Key Learning:
- AI basics
- Timer nodes
- Respawning / resetting scenes

Session 5: Power Pellets + Ghost Scared Mode
- Goal: Add power-ups that make ghosts vulnerable.
- Add power pellet nodes.
- Change ghost color/state when eaten.
- Implement a timer for scared mode.

Key Learning:
- State management
- Scene signals
- Timers

Session 6: Polish + UI
Goal: Make it look and feel like Pac-Man.
- Add sound and animations.
- Add start and game over screens.
- Improve maze visuals.

Key Learning:
- AnimationPlayer
- AudioStreamPlayer2D
- Scene transitions

Optional Sessions
- Pathfinding using A* for smarter ghosts
- Score saving / high scores
- Multiple levels or custom mazes

🧩 Recommended Open Source Projects (for reference / reverse engineering)

These are free, open-source Godot Pac-Man clones — perfect for learning structure and comparing approaches.
